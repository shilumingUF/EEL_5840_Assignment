## Assignment 00
## Due Friday, August 30 @ 11:59pm

1. If you do not already have them, install:
    * an editor: You are welcome to use whatever editor you would like.  There are many many options. See: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors  Lately, I have been using SublimeText (which is what I will be using in class).
    * Python 3+, the NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib packages, and Jupyter notebooks on the computer(s) you will be bringing to class and using to complete your assignments. An easy way to install Python 3+ and all required packages is to install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. Review all of the pre-requisite material in the pre-requisite lecture notes. Read all of the supplementary reading and watch all of the videos for topics you do not recall well. 

3. If you do not have one, create a github account. Please select a username that is professional and clearly indicates who you are (e.g., my username is alinazare).   

4.  If you are not familiar with git, complete one (or a few) introductory tutorials:
    * Git bootcamp: https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/
    * Tutorials: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
    * Interactive Introduction: https://try.github.io/

5. Follow the assignment link for assignment repository.  After accepting the invitation, clone the repository to your local machine. 

6. Then, code up a python 3 program that prints the following:

      My name is:<br>
      [your name] <br>
      My github username is:<br>
      [username]<br>
      I am a:<br>
      [undergraduate/masters/PhD] student <br>
      I am majoring in: <br>
      [your major]<br>
      My level of programming experience in general is:<br>
      [none/some/extensive]<br>
      My python programming experience is:<br>
      [none/some/extensive]<br>
      My git experience is: <br>
     [none/some/extensive]<br>
      My machine learning experience is:<br>
      [none/some/extensive]<br>
      I reviewed the pre-requisite notes and carefully reviewed all associated material for topics I do not recall well: <br>
      [no/yes]<br>
      I am excited to learn the following in this class: <br>
      [complete with your response]<br>

7.  Starter code has been provided for you in your homework repository.  You only need to edit, *verify that it runs properly*, and push back your submission. You should use git push to submit your changes (do not upload). You should NOT change the name of the primary file.  We will only run hw00.py for grading.  You will get a 0 if you submit your homework under any other filename. 

8.  Submit this through GitHub by pushing your completed code back to the github assignment repository.  

9.  This assignment is worth 10 points.  The rubric for grading is:
  - 5 points: code was modified and runs without error
  - 4 points: all responses were provided
  - 1 point: Pre-requisite material was reviewed and indicated as such in the assignment response
